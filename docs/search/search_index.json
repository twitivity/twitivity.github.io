Account Activity API allows you to subscribe to user activities. Unlike Twitter's REST API or the Streaming API, the Account Activity API delivers data through webhook connections. Which makes it faster and allows it to deliver Twitter data to you in real-time. You can subscribe to these user activities . Getting Started Apply for a Twitter Developer Account Create an application , fill in the required fields, the callback URL is your domain name with an added endpoint, for example https://yourdomain.com/listener . Twitter will later use this URL to send you account activity data. Make sure to enable \"Read, Write and Direct messages\" permission. Navigate to the Dev environment section and setup a dev environment for the Account Activity API. Name a dev environment label of your choosing and select your app. The next step is to register your webhook URL. Twitter will send a GET request with Challenge-Response Check or CRC token to verify you are the owner of the app and the webhook URL. To validate, an encrypted response token based on your consumer key and the CRC token has to be sent back to Twitter. Upon successful validation, registration of the webhook URL and subscription. Twitter will send data to this endpoint (the webhook URL) as a POST request. Why Twitivity? Twitivity does all the heavy lifting under the hood. All you have to do is to create an app and set up a dev environment. Run the application and concentrate on what's really important \u2014 building your app. Performs challenge-response check validation Registers webhook URL. Subscribes to current user's context Receives Twitter Account Activity in real-time Usage Ngrok is a handy tool to try out the API locally, on your machine. Install and run ngrok and replace your app's URL and callback URL with the link ngrok provides.
